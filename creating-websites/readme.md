This is your basic introduction to coding for the web. In this course you’ll go from learning what websites are made up of and how to start coding your own web pages. At the end of the course you’ll also look at how to setup and customise your own website.

To start off with you’ll look at the two main languages used to create websites: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) & CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). You’ll learn how HTML is used to structure the content of your web pages, from the very basic methods of how to structure a paragraph of text through to learning about some of the latest HTML elements being introduced in the modern web. When you have a structured page of content you can then start adding some design with CSS. You’ll see how to control layout, colours, typography and much more, later on in the course you’ll even take a look at some modern CSS3 techniques to enhance your web page with animations and transitions.

The final part of the course will take a look at setting up and configuring your own website using WordPress.com. You’ll learn about the features WordPress.com offers and also how to select and customise themes for your content using the skills you’ve learned in the first part of the course.
